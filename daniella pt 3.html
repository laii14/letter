<h1 style="color:brown;">Hello Mader</h1>
<p>
<p style="color:brown;">In today's globalized world, geographical distances often separate family members. Yet, technology and determination can transcend physical boundaries, nurturing love and connection.
 Meet my family.

  <p style="color:brown;">Each member of our family doesn't stay on one household. my parents are separated. me and my sibling stay on our grandmother's house while our mom work in boracay to provide our financial needs,
 and she also invites us to go there for vacation every christmas and new year's eve. My fathers hometown is in mindanao, and he also works there as an kapitan on their baranggay.
 my father and i don't talk that much but i still have my mom checking up on us everyday.

 <p style="color:brown;">We're not a complete family but we're happy on our own perspectives. We dont have any pets on our house so it's just me and my older brother. We are mostly alone on the house and we dont bond that much,
 and since we're both blessed with our talent in singing, thats the only way that we bond.

 <p style="color:brown;">My family only experienced having a reunion once and i was a kid back then so i dont really remember everything, but that's the only time that we're complete so i don 't really have much to say to them. 

<p style="color:brown;">I only consider my mom my family and she is the most precious thing that i have.
she does everything for us, even though she's tired of working she always finds a way to call and asks if how our day went. 
she always supports us at everything and gives everything as long as she has something to give. 
she's my only inspiration to learn and work hard for my dreams, she always believes that i can do it and, I appreciate her so much, and i'm thankful i got to call her my mom.</p>
